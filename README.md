# Calcium Imaging Analyzer App - Git Repository:

This repository will contain an app that facilitates the analysis of calcium imaging data. 
The app is currently under development and undergoes major changes. Thus, all python source code is still stored in my 'AppsInDev' repository. Future changes to the app will be managed in this repository as soon as I release a working beta version.
